                that's all, thanks
                
                these are the bots that have access. Let me know if you need anything else
                
                I kind of want to see if the bots use user permissions or its own permissions to display channels
                
                can you give the bots access to the hidden channels?
                
                do you need anything else?
                
                nope
                
                <@405162577673453569> do you see <#1242891173937287191> ?
                
                ok
                
                sure, i might need to change permission for everyone
                
                <@330475170835726347> can you create a channel that I don't have access to?

                sure, i might need to change permission for everyone
                
                <@330475170835726347> can you create a channel that I don't have access to?

                these are the bots that have access. Let me know if you need anything else
                
                I kind of want to see if the bots use user permissions or its own permissions to display channels
                
                can you give the bots access to the hidden channels?
                
                do you need anything else?
